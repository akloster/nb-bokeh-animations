Animating Bokeh Graphs
===

This a set of two notebooks to demonstrate how to update bokeh
animations after initially rendering them inside the IPython
notebook.

This allows you to drive animations from Python or visualize
ongoing computations.

This code is highly experimental. The underlying APIs will
probably change soon.
